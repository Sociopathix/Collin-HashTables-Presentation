# Java HashSets Lesson

In this lesson, you will learn about the basics of the HashSet class, a data structure of 
unique items. You will learn what a HashSet is, how to create and use objects, its methods, 
and what HashSets are useful for!

If you'd like to read more about HashSets, I suggest starting with this [Geeks for Geeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/interfaces-in-java/).
