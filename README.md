# Java HashSets Lesson

In this lesson, you will learn about the basics of the HashSet class, a data structure of 
unique items. You will learn what a HashSet is, how to create and use objects, its methods, 
and what HashSets are useful for!

If you'd like to read more about Interfaces, which we briefly discuss but don't get into, I suggest starting with this [Geeks for Geeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/interfaces-in-java/).\
The online Java compiler I often use in class can be found [here](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/), and the compiler
with the completed example code can be found [here](https://www.programiz.com/online-compiler/5hbXkM05lqlEt).

Let me know if you have any questions!
